## Settings for nvim on a Windows machine

- folder for settings is %USERNAME%\AppData\Local\nvim
- settings are based on Primeagen show
- hoply to use on each win machine 

# Why not LunarVim (is so fancy and already configured)?

- I've created settings for better understanding nvim plugins 
- LunarVim is not easy to install (not on Linux machines) - U need some make some tricks
- So i decide to use booth - simmillar set :D 

Enjoy myself
